I started my tech career working with databases, writing SQL, Stored Procedures, building Data Warehouses and Data Lakes so my company could present meaningful insights to their clients both in the private and public sector. Since then, I have traveled the world leveraging that knowledge, learning, and creating a vast array of solutions in the Business Intelligence space until I successfully moved to Full Stack development and early Machine Learning days during my Master's Degree program.

After getting my degree in Boston, I started to explore Full Stack opportunities and, in the meantime, I developed a complete desktop Java solution from scratch for my university. The solution aimed to assist and automate internal quality assurance efforts by taking one or multiple test plan spreadsheets that outlined the quality certification process for internal use  software. At the end, a report was produced with the results automating and exposing important metrics for the deparment.

Since that opportunity, I worked in the fintech space building Full Stack B2B solutions and Bluetooth Low Energy software for companies that aimed to modernize real estate buildings in NY, Boston, and San Francisco.

<u>In early 2025, I have made a decision to transition to the Gaming Industry. Since then, I have been studying, practicing, and working through Unity's pathway program building simple games, learning Unity Editor, and coding in C# for Unity's game engine</u>. Soon you can find games I have working on in the top menu bar. My most recent achievement was the completion of the <a href="https://learn.unity.com/pathway/unity-essentials">Unity Essentials Pathway</a>. I aim to continue to hone these C# skills to handle interactions between the user (player) and the engine. I have always been fascinated by how and what happens under the hood and my curiosity has always been one of the pillars in what I consider a requirement to succeed at any task in software engineering.
