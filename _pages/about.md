I started my tech career working with databases, writing SQL and procedures, and building Data Warehouses and Data Lakes so that the company I spent 7 years working for could present meaningful insights to their clients. Since then, I have traveled the world leveraging that knowledge, learning, and creating a vast array of solutions in the Business Intelligence space until I migrated to general Software Development around 2014.

After getting my Master's Degree in Boston, I started to explore Full Stack opportunities and ended up developing a complete solution from scratch built in Java for my university. The solution aimed to assist and automate internal quality assurance efforts for certifying other software for internal use. It was designed to leverage test plan spreadsheets and automate the testing of each function listed in the spreadsheets. Up until that point, everything was done manually.

Since then, I have joined local Fintech companies and hardware solution companies that leverage Bluetooth Low Energy to modernize real estate buildings in NY, Boston, and San Francisco.

Lately, I have been studying, practicing, and building games using Unity 3D as a Unity Programmer with C#. My most recent achievement was the completion of the <a href="https://learn.unity.com/pathway/unity-essentials">Unity Essentials Pathway</a>. I aim to complete all Pathways and obtain the <a href="https://unity.com/products/unity-certifications/user-programmer">Unity Certified User: Programmer</a>, <a href="https://unity.com/products/unity-certifications/associate-game-developer">Unity Certified Associate: Game Developer</a>, and <a href="https://unity.com/products/unity-certifications/associate-programmer">Unity Certified Associate: Programmer</a> certifications.
